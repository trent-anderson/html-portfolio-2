        <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>I have been doing software engineering for around a year or so. It has been kind of a wild adventure, and I am very grateful for all that I have learned.</p>

        <p>I grew up in Eagle, Idaho for the most part. I have three brothers and one sister. I served as a full-time missionary for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints from June of 2010 to June of 2012.</p>

        <p>I look forward to hopefully mastering many more concepts of computer programming.</p>
